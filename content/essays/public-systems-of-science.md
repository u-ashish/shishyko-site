#### NOTE! This is just a draft! The final version is under review and will be published elsewhere, but sharing in the spirit of feedback.

> I believed that the most important software [...] needed to be built like cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation... the Linux community seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge. - Eric Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar

Not too long ago, there was only "one correct way" to build software: highly centralized, hierarchical, meticulously planned, opaque. Eventually, a new decentralized mechanism to coordinate those involved emerged within the Linux ecosystem. It was almost Darwinian - the way ideas surfaced, got developed, and were maintained over time. Though it seemed chaotic from the outside, there was a seductive fluidity, and this new system proved far more adaptive and transparent.

This exact tension exists in our systems of science today. Traditionally slow, siloed, static. Great science still happens - this is after all a system that gave us CRISPR, CAR-T cell therapy, and so much more.

But how much better could it be?

Reflecting on Eric Raymond's analysis in *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, I can't help but wonder: what would science look like if scientists worked in public - outside of the silos of their labs and organizations? In what ways could scientists share knowledge faster to drive collaboration and innovation without sacrificing credit, and instead gain proper recognition for their own ideas and contributions?

### The Cathedral of Science

Back in my research days, we'd have weekly lab meetings with our team of overworked, underpaid, unbelievably brilliant scientists.

We'd share updates on experiments and hypotheses, chat about a new paper someone published about a really specific immune target, and show off what we knew, all while devouring glorious free food: donuts, bagels, coffee.

We held each other accountable, and learned from one another. All that juicy knowledge tucked away in each of our brains.

> "No, no, you can't trust that paper. That PI always fudges their data in these ways. See? I'm not sure we can incorporate those ideas into our own experiments."

> "Hmm. It'd be interesting if we could induce liver cancer in mice with underlying cirrhosis. We already have a way of doing the latter with CCL4. What about an AAV-8 mediated approach?"

I wish I recorded these conversations. Across all labs. And then indexed them to be discovered by others.

Instead, the knowledge contained within that months to years long process of hypothesizing and running experiments, constantly refined through ongoing discussions and tinkering with our entire team, was collapsed into one paper.

We'd finish a draft, submit it for peer review, and then went through yet another opaque process that took months with editing, revisions, sometimes new experiments.

Eventually, months or years later, our revised, typeset manuscript would be beautifully displayed for others. Hopefully with the word `nature` somewhere in the header. And a list of authors, where the first and last got the bulk of the credit and the rest were just there, doing who knows what.

Does it really have to be this way?
  
What if, instead, we worked in public? Published hypotheses, experiments, and findings (positive and negative) every week, and got feedback from others, in and outside of our lab?

### The Experiment is our Building Block

Indeed many have lamented the problems plaguing science. Solutions have been difficult, because unlike classic software where users flock to better products and services, this ecosystem is gripped by a career incentive system comprised of universities and publishers.  Papers, and the citations they accrue, are still the dominant currency for grants, promotions, and tenure.

Communities of scientists have long recognized these problems and attempted to address it from within. Physicists started making their own findings accessible faster in the early 90s, which eventually turned into arXiv. Now, we have a number of preprint servers from bioRxiv, chemRxiv, medRxiv that allow scientists in those fields to share their publications before peer-review.

Though preprints were an important step in making science more accessible, they don't address the *form* of science. The paper, in its polished glory, is still treated as the fundamental output of the scientific process.

But science isn't done in papers. It's done in weekly experiments, discussions, dead ends, tinkering, refining, and occasional flashes of insight. Can the paper itself be unbundled into smaller units of knowledge? 

New approaches led by researchers are gradually emerging. Consider for example [Discourse Graphs](https://joelchan.me/assets/pdf/Discourse_Graphs_for_Augmented_Knowledge_Synthesis_What_and_Why.pdf) which were originally described by Joel Chan and are becoming a [new, usable protocol](https://discoursegraphs.com/) for researchers to share their own knowledge -- within their labs and outside.

Discourse Graphs represent research ideas as modular, interlinked claims: hypotheses, evidence, critiques, questions. Each node can be attributed, versioned, and connected to others, making it possible to track the evolution of thought over time. They enable insights to be published in smaller chunks - like code commits or GitHub issue threads - while maintaining traceability, credit, and context.

Imagine if every lab meeting, idea, brainstorming session, experimental decision lived in such a shared, explorable graph. Not buried in notebooks or brains, but organized, attributed, and discoverable -- by your future self, your peers, and the broader scientific community.
### Public Science

Protocols like Discourse Graphs, if shared beyond the confines of individual labs, offer a future for science that helps scientists scale with the explosion of information, get credit that reflects their actual contributions, and enable discoveries and ideation beyond their own epistemic bubbles.

The bazaar of open science wonâ€™t build itself. But piece by piece -- through shared tools, open experiments, and new norms -- we might finally bring science out of The Cathedral, and into the commons.
