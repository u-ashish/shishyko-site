> Scientific progress on a broad front results from the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown. - Vannevar Bush

What a whirlwind year it's been. 2025. Generative AI is transforming the way we process raw data and information, with drastic impact across industries, and a breakneck speed of progress. 

Perhaps more significant is its timing: a moment in history where the scientific funding framework in the United States is towards the tail end of the post-world war 2 order, and when the scientific publishing ecosystem has been revealing its cracks under an exponentially increasing volume of information over the past two decades.

The whole thing is gearing up to buckle under the pressure and create opportunities for a once-in-a-century rewrite of the scientific operating system -- from discovery to commercialization.

How did we get here? And what might come next?

### Framework for Scientific Progress

Science is amazing -- not just intellectually, but in its real impact. We've witnessed many amazing discoveries and programs over the last few decades: CRISPR gene editing, the Human Genome Project, MRI, and more.

Nurturing systems to promote scientific inquiry and progress -- with respect to research direction, advancement of knowledge, development of technologies in public interest, and the nurture of scientific talent -- is a key concern of any society.

After World War 2, Vannevar Bush wrote his famous memo, *Science -- The Endless Frontier* to outline the importance of a framework for relationships between the federal government and universities to maintain global relevance for the United States. This led to the creation of a framework where the federal government would fund basic research done at Universities, developed a pipeline for domestic scientific talent, and more.

Shortly after was another inflection point in our journey: the Bayh-Dole Act, which intended to ensure that tax-payer funded research would not only advance knowledge, but be translated into technologies, products, or services that benefitted the public. Who owns the IP for inventions? How do we promote its commercialization?

Universities not only became key pipelines of scientific talent and centers of basic research, but evolved into engines of innovation through Technology Transfer Offices (TTO), and more. They continued to bundle more and more functions into their overall purpose in society.

Over time, other groups began to enter the orbit of this budding scientific system. Most notably, scholarly societies and publishers, which started as a way to disseminate science, increasingly influenced how science is done, and how new knowledge is, and is not shared.

### How "Science" is Done

*I put "Science" in quotes because this section describes the broader institution of science, not just the essentials.*

Scholarly societies and publishers started out as communities of scientists found each other, shared their findings, and built on their collective understanding of the world. At one point time (think printing press), this made lots of sense.

As new technologies emerged, publishers needed to cement their role instead of becoming irrelevant - they are, after all, businesses, with a mandate to not just exist, but grow.

One way to create staying power as a publisher is to:

- Monetize access to read, or publish content, which you can defend through copyright laws
- Ensure that people *have to* publish with you by:

	- Creating prestige by defining different levels of importance for journals
	- Building a network of reviewers to review content ready for publication to ensure it's "held to a necessary standard"
	- Ensuring that citations -- the primary mechanism to build on scientific knowledge -- becomes a currency for one's career through impact, rankings, and more, by working with indices and agencies that track these measures
	- Creating secondary mechanisms of career advancement -- through professional networks, and more, mediated by your society.

This is not an evil scheme by publishers tricking everyone else, but an optimization by all players around the perverse incentives they have.

Consider the perspective of a university: if a significant portion of revenue comes from indirect costs on grants, how do we retain faculty securing those grants?

- Tie tenure to publications, impact, and prestige (with the help of publishers, ranking agencies, and more)
- Universities pay publishers significant money (>$10B/year globally) to read the research their own faculty, and others, publish

Indeed this is all-too familiar for most scientists, and this became the de-facto system everyone participates in.

While this kind of a system can work, it has led to a number of issues.
- The creation of silos of information that are not interoperable between research institutes and labs
- A disincentive to publish important findings. Why share something as soon as you have it, if you can mine it for a little more to get ahead of someone else? *(This one I've witnessed first hand when I was doing research)*
- A disincentive to publish negative results
- An inefficient peer-review system built on underpaid (or unpaid) labor, which simply cannot scale with the exponential rate of increase in new publications *(At a recent conference, someone proposed that publishers pay for coffee for reviewers!)*
- An incentive to falsify results -- in egregious but also in subtle ways -- to get more funding.
- Getting a publication is treated like a stamp of approval. "This is good enough and everything looks right and sound".
- A narrative driven format for scientific findings, instead of a focus on the facts and "knowledge units"

While aspects of this system may have been sensible decades ago, it is ill-equipped to face the challenges in today's information and knowledge age.

Worse, it has significant inertia, which makes even incremental change virtually impossible.

### A Shifting Federal Landscape

Recent political events are (arguably) a black swan event. Much of the federal framework used to fund science is being dismantled, and universities are looking to identify alternative sources of revenue (from indirect costs on grants to something else), and face an unbundling of different functions they took on in the last few decades.

Time will tell exactly how this plays out, but these changes are already opening the door for new models of experimentation between universities, ecosystem developers (venture, foundations, etc.), and industry.

Is the revenue cliff universities face from a decline in grants / indirect costs enough to change how science is fundamentally done? I'd argue in isolation, it's not enough, because universities can adapt by exploring other funding opportunities (foundations, donors, etc.), and hedging by exploring industry partnerships and commercialization activity.

### The Generative AI Moment

If uncertainty at the federal level is creating one set of opportunities around scientific inquiry and commercialization, recent advances in large language models create the real opening around reforming the scientific system.

Much of the mechanisms we've built were predicated on data and information being worked on at what I call "people scale": the natural limits at which a group of people can reasonably organize and do things (think analysts, peer review, etc.).

If a computer can reliably start to do this at 100x or 1000x the efficiency, the existing system simply cannot cope.

Large language models are rapidly getting us to a point where we can:

- Address issues of information overload through agentic systems that can contextually evaluate the relevance of significantly more articles than an individual human
- Have new ways to formulate hypothesis, analyze data
- Streamline how we communicate findings and build on our knowledge

### A Once in a Century Rewrite

Scientists are hackers and painters. They want to creatively express themselves, and solve problems they find interesting. The incumbent system oppresses this core function.

What does a new scientific operating system look like that preserves the basic tenets of scientific inquiry, without compromising the benefits of science for humanity?

A well-designed *scientific operating system (SciOS)* — meaning the infrastructure, tools, norms, and institutions that support the full lifecycle of scientific inquiry — should *optimize for truth-seeking, openness, collaboration, and impact*. In essence, it should _let good science happen faster, more reliably, and more inclusively_.

Stated differently, such a system should:

- Support the publication of *knowledge units*, not just fully formed narratives
- Allow for *continuous iteration* -- meaning publishing intermediate results
- Make all findings accessible, discoverable, and machine-readable
- Make things like replication checks, data sharing, etc. native to the system
- Create norms that reward and incentivize *openness instead of secrecy*
- Give granular attribution for scientists -- not just first and last authors

This is not just a new toolset. It's a new system that serves the creatives who do the science, and the public that depends on it.
